<h2>
Simulate fluctuations in species abundances across time
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The arguments in <code>syngenr</code> are set to predefined default values, which can of course
be customised, or sampled from parameter spaces
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
syngenr(years = 100, n_sp = 16, max_rel_abu = 0.6, tot_abu = 300, power = 1.8, switch_env = c("on", "off"), mean_env_resp = 1, sd_env_resp = 1, bimodal_env = FALSE, comp = FALSE, switch_trend = c("on", "off"), mean_trend_resp = 1, sd_trend_resp = 1, bimodal_trend = FALSE, bound_pos = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>years</code></td>
<td>
<p>the length of the timeseries in years.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>n_sp</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of species in the community.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tot_abu</code></td>
<td>
<p>total abundance of the community, representing e.g. the number of
individuals or the total amount of biomass.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>the slope of the relationship between log(mean) and log(variance) of
the abundances of the species.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>switch_env</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of length 1, either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. Defines if the
species abundances repond to a hypothetical environmental cue.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mean_env_resp</code></td>
<td>
<p>the mean of the normal distribution from which each of the
species responses to the environemtnal cue is drawn.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sd_env_resp</code></td>
<td>
<p>the standard deviation around the mean of the normal distribution
from which each of the species responses to the environemtnal cue is drawn.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>bimodal_env</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Making the reponse to the environmental cue either
uniform among the species (if FALSE), or making the majority of half of the
species respond positively, and the other half negatively.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>comp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If TRUE, species exhibit compensatory dynamics, i.e. the gain
of abundance in a species from one year to the next, is compensated by the
loss of abundance in another species, where the latter has a similar mean
abundance value.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>switch_trend</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;, defining if there is a general monotonic
trend in abundances of species across the timeseries.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mean_trend_resp</code></td>
<td>
<p>the mean of the normal distribution from which each of the
species responses to the longterm trend is drawn. Default is 1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>sd_trend_resp</code></td>
<td>
<p>the standard deviation around the mean of the normal
distribution from which each of the species responses to the longterm trend is
drawn. Default is 1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>bimodal_trend</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If TRUE, the majority of half of the species exhibit a
positive long term trend of abundances, and the other half expresses a
negative long term trend. If FALSE, most of the species exhibit a uniform long
term trend in abundances, depending on the value set for mean_trend and
mean_sd.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>bound_pos</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If true, abundance values that are simulated to be
negative, will be set to zero.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is a list with four elements
</p>
<p><code>$time_species_matrix</code>: the simulated temporal community data where species are columns and years are rows.
</p>
<p><code>$param_years</code>: values for the evnironmental cue and the trend throughout the years. Note that these contain values even if the environment or trend are
switched off.
</p>
<p><code>$param_species</code>: a data frame containing the responses to the environment and the long term trend, as well as the mean abundance and its standard deviation for each species in the community.
</p>
<p><code>$param_general</code>: a data frame with only one row, containing all the parameter settings from the function call.
