Title: Analyses of Temporal Community Data
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Lars", "GÃ¶tzenberger", email = "lars.goetzenberger@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides various functions to caclulate different 
  indices for temporal communities, i.e. communitie data (plots, samples) that 
  have been collected over several years. This includes various measures of 
  synchrony (and randomisation based tests) and stability. Temporal community 
  data can also be simulated according to a simple mathematical model, where 
  parameters can be set to produce certain patterns of species fluctuatios 
  (synchrony, antisynchrony, random fluctuations, temporal trends).
